The goal is to implement a content-based image retrieval system that supports multiple methods. Of course, it is mainly a demonstration rather than a real-world application.

**Note:** This is not a complete project, it exists as a homework for *HZAU Summer Training 2020 - Content Based Image Retrieval*.
