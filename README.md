The goal is to implement a content-based image retrieval system that supports multiple methods. Of course, it is mainly a demonstration rather than a real-world application.

**Note:** This is not a complete project, it exists as a homework for *HZAU Summer Training 2020 - Content Based Image Retrieval*.

## Status

**Simple Demo**, just repeat two tutorials of pyImageSearch. Lack of availability and quality assurance.

## TODO

- [ ] More reasonable work flow, minimize manual operation.
- [ ] More effective search. 
    - [ ] Support uploading files and randomly selecting pictures in the gallery.
    - [ ] Improve retrieval speed.
    - [ ] Support more search methods.
- [ ] Better UI.
- [ ] Access Control.
- [ ] Others - Basic Guides. (?)

## Usage

Since the project is not yet perfect, here is only an overview of the process rather than specific steps.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Put the images (**JPG Only**) into the dataset folder.
3. Index pictures.
4. Select pictures to search.
